## Map data

The topology is the world-atlas 2.0.2 redistribution of Natural Earth 4.1.0 Admin 0 country boundaries at 1:50m scale. It contains country and territory geometry, with names and ISO numeric IDs. Natural Earth data is public domain: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/ . Package documentation: https://github.com/topojson/world-atlas/tree/v2.0.2 .

The globe follows the dataset's boundary representation. Headline geography is inferred from mentions in titles and publisher excerpts; the map does not establish a precise event location. Country shapes and names are not a political endorsement.
